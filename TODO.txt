 * it would be nice if the zoom  zooms into a selected element and not anywhere else

   another idea is to highlight the selection by an animation. like a shrinking cross or something similar.

 * Filter all matches such that there are no overlapping ones.

 * talk to Jochen (Primer)
 * implement: Jochens sliding window ordering
 * implement: load multiple matchings in different tabs
 * ask the support for new repository: cat
