 * it would be nice if the zoom  zooms into a selected element and not anywhere else
 * marked objects could get a mouse over effect which displays the relevandt information
 * it is quite difficult to find very small selected contigs/matches. if the image is zoomed the selected match could be centered.
   another idea is to highlight the selection by an animation. like a shrinking cross or something similar.

 * Try to find the real target start and end position instead of the bucket positions in the q-gram filter
 * Filter all matches such that there are no overlapping ones.
