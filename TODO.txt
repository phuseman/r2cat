 * it would be nice if the zoom  zooms into a selected element and not anywhere else
 * it is quite difficult to find very small selected contigs/matches. if the image is zoomed the selected match could be centered.
   another idea is to highlight the selection by an animation. like a shrinking cross or something similar.

 * Try to find the real target start and end position instead of the bucket positions in the q-gram filter
 * Filter all matches such that there are no overlapping ones.

 * talk to Jochen (Primer)
 * implement: load multiple matchings in different tabs

 * If a set of contigs was ordered using several reference chromosomes (one genome!), then it would be nice to output the contigs for each chromosome seperately. At the moment ther is an ordering, but from the file it is not distinguishable according to which reference it was ordered.
