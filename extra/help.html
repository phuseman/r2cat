<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
With the help of next generation sequencing technologies it is feasible
to generate a lot of reads for a given genome. However, the assembly
usually ends up in a set of contigs with gaps between them.
If a similar reference genome is known it the contigs can be mapped onto
this and the size of the gaps can be estimated. This way, it is possible
to design specific primer sequences to fill the gaps and finish the
assembly.

<h2><a name="descr">Description</a></h2>
This is the tool r2cat, which maps contigs onto a
reference genome using a q-gram filter.
The contigs are ordered by a simple procedure and the result is visualized.
It is planned to incorporate the information of multiple references to
compute a more reliable order of the contigs.

<h2>Starting the application</h2>
You can start r2cat with the java web start framework.
